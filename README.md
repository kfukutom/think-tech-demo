# Think Technologies Chatbot UI, Detroit MI

Welcome to the Chatbot UI repository for Think Technologies. This was initially forked from a open-source project, providing a sleek, modern user interface for building chatbots that can be easily integrated into any web application. Designed with responsiveness and customizability in mind, this UI is built on Vercel's powerful frontend framework.
